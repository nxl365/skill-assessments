### oncoplot

An oncoplot is a form of mutation heatmap that visually presents genomic alterations in genes across multiple samples (usually cancer patients). The primary purpose of an oncoplot is to offer a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of a cancer cohort.
When you make an oncoplot of the top five mutated genes, you're creating a plot that shows the five genes that have the most mutations in your data set.

Here's a general breakdown of what you might see in an oncoplot:

1. Sample/Patient Bar: Along the top, there's usually a bar for each sample or patient. The color and length of each bar segment represent the mutation load of each sample.

2. Gene Panel: Each row in the main body of the plot represents one of the genes. The colors in this part of the plot represent different types of mutations: missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc.

3. Mutation Count Bar: On the right side, there's typically a bar graph showing the number of mutations in each gene.

4. Mutational Signatures: At the bottom, you might see the mutational signatures, a graphical representation of the mutation types and their frequency.

In an oncoplot of the top five mutated genes, the plot will focus on the five genes with the most mutations. This means that the plot can help you quickly identify which genes are most frequently mutated in your data set, what types of mutations they have, and how these mutations are distributed among your samples.
